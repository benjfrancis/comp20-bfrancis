        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>This is a security analysis of a web application created by Cam Flowers that retrieves a user's
        current location, and uses the Google Maps API to display this location
        on a map.  The application also places the location of all other users
        and nearby landmarks of the map.  This security analysis is primarily
        interested in finding vulnerabilities in the server side API that this
        web application uses. </p>

        <h1>Methodology</h1>
        <p>First, typical vulnerabilities were investigated without looking at the
        source code.  This is also known as black box testing.  After this was
        completed, the source code was examined in an effort to find additional
        vulnerabilities.  This is known as white box testing.  In this security
        analysis, the only tool used was the "curl" command.  This was used to 
        POST data to the /sendLocation API.  All of the vulnerabilities were 
        found using this method.</p>
        
        <h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>
        <p>Several vulnerabilities were found with just the /sendLocation API.  The
        server was not written to fully check the user input.  This means that users
        were able to insert anything they wanted into the database.  This includes,
        but is not limited to, malicious scripts using JavaScript, unwanted HTML 
        content, and invalid data. All of these vulnerabilities will provide issues
        for any user trying to use this web application.
</p> 

        <h1>Issues</h1>

        <h2>Issue 1: Cross Site Scripting</h2>
        <h3>Severity: High</h3>
        <p>The first vulnerability found in this analysis was cross site scripting.
        It was found that any script can be placed in the 'login' parameter of the
        POST to the '/sendLocation' API.  This can be seen below. In this case, 
        an alert script was inserted that will pop up with a window saying 
        'test post please ignore.' The POST request completes as expected.
</p> 
        
        <img src="images/xss_command.png" alt="xss_command" style="width:720px;height:80px;">

        <p>When users try to view the database information using the '/' API, the 
        script that was inserted will run when the page tries to display login.
        This is due to the fact that the '/' API blindly appends anything in the 
        login field to the HTML page that is is going to display.  The resulting
        alert image that resulted from the inserted script can be seen below.</p>
       
        <img src="images/xss_result.png" alt="xss_result" style="width:720px;height:875px;">

        <p>Despite this being a very severe issue, there is a very easy fix. 
        Before placing the userâ€™s login information into the database, the API
        should check for several specific characters.  Most importantly, the API
        should remove '<' and '>' as this will break any scripts that are 
        potentially in the user input.  These characters can be replaced with
        &lt and &gt respectively.
</p>
        

        
        <h2>Issue 2: HTML Injection</h2>
        
        <h3>Severity: Medium</h3>
        
        <p>This issue was also found with the '/sendLocation' API.  After 
        successfully inserting scripts into the login parameter, it was suspected
        that HTML content could also be injected in the same manner.  The command
        below was executed.  It inserted a large, obnoxious message as a h1 into 
        the database.  This is a slightly less sever issue compared to the XSS
        issue, as much more malicious things can be done with a script
        compared to injected HTML content.  The HTML injection can only add 
        content, while a script could be used to remove or manipulate other 
        content displayed on the webpage.</p>
        
        <img src="images/html_inject_command.png" alt="html_inject_command" style="width:720px;height:90px;">
        
        <p>When viewing the database using the '/' API, the HTML content that was 
        previous inserted into the database is blindly displayed in much the same 
        way that the scripts in Issue 1 were executed.  The resulting page can 
        be seen below. Notice the large 'This should not be here.' message
        proceeding the 'guest' login.</p>
        
        <img src="images/html_inject_result.png" alt="html_inject_result" style="width:720px;height:875px;">

        <p>This issue can be fixed in the exact same issue as the XSS issue; simply
        remove and replace key characters such as '<' and '>'.  This will 
        break the HTML format and the attempted injection will just be displayed
        as a string.</p>

        <h2>Issue 3: Invalid Data</h2>
        <h3>Severity: Medium</h3>
        <p>This was yet another issue with the 'sendLocation' API.  In this case,
        after examining the code, it was found that the API does not check to make
        sure that the latitude and longitude are numbers.  It simply inserts them 
        into the database and then performs operations on them assuming that they 
        are strings.  This results in an application error.  The command and 
        application error can be seen below.</p>

        <img src="images/blah_command.png" alt="blah_command" style="width:720px;height:311px;">

        <p>It is important to note that the application error occurs after the 
        values are already inserted into the database.  This means that any user 
        trying to use the API will get application errors when they try to display
        locations on a Google Map when the latitude or longitude are not numbers.
        The inserted data can be seen below.  Notice the value 'blah' for guest5 
        in the list of checkins.  
</p>
        
        <img src="images/blah_result.png" alt="blah_result" style="width:720px;height:875px;">

        <p>This issue is not very difficult to fix. Before doing anything with
        the latitude and longitude, the API should make sure that these values
        are indeed valid numbers.  After this check, if it is found that the values
        are not strings, the API can respond to the user with the 'Something is 
        wrong with your data' JSON file.  This would prevent any other users'
        applications from breaking via invalid data.</p>

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>There were several vulnerabilities with the '/sendLocation' API which resulted in various errors and interruptions in the user experience.  All of
        the vulnerabilities can be easily fixed by more carefully processing user
        input.  Additionally, in future applications it would likely be a good idea
        to secure the API such that only authenticated users can POST data to the
        server.  It is dangerous to allow anyone to POST data to the server, as 
        there are many malicious users out on the web looking to exploit vulnerable
        websites and web applications.  Seeing as these vulnerabilities are 
        relatively easy to fix, it will only cost the client about $100 to fix.
